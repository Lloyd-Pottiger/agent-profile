# Improve Codebase Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

## Glossary

This skill speaks the shared deep-module vocabulary from the [`codebase-design`](../codebase-design) skill. Consult [LANGUAGE.md](../codebase-design/LANGUAGE.md) for the canonical definitions of **module**, **interface**, **implementation**, **depth** (deep vs shallow), **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**, and **locality**, and for the principles that do the work here — the deletion test, "the interface is the test surface," and "one adapter means a hypothetical seam, two means a real one." Use these terms exactly; don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."

This skill is informed by the project's domain model: `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, and any ADRs under `docs/adr/`. Domain language gives names to good seams; ADRs record decisions this skill should not re-litigate.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Read existing documentation first:

- `CONTEXT.md` (or `CONTEXT-MAP.md` + each `CONTEXT.md` in a multi-context repo)
- Relevant ADRs in `docs/adr/` (and any context-scoped `docs/adr/` directories)

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently — don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront.

Explore the codebase directly. If the user explicitly asks for delegated or parallel agent work, split independent exploration questions across explorer agents; otherwise keep the exploration local. Don't follow rigid heuristics — explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

### 2. Present candidates

Present a numbered list of deepening opportunities. For each candidate:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality and leverage, and also in how tests would improve

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary for the domain, and [LANGUAGE.md](../codebase-design/LANGUAGE.md) vocabulary for the architecture.** If `CONTEXT.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module" — not "the FooBarHandler," and not "the Order service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly (e.g. _"contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

If the exploration target is not yet determined, ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?" If the user has already specified a module or candidate, continue its analysis and design directly.

### 3. Grilling loop

For the selected or user-specified candidate, work through constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, and what tests survive. Ask only about unresolved material decisions; continue analysis and design when the available context is sufficient.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in `CONTEXT.md`?** Add the term to `CONTEXT.md`. Create the file lazily if it doesn't exist. Keep entries concise: term, definition, key invariants, and related modules.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `CONTEXT.md` right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR, framed as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a future explorer to avoid re-suggesting the same thing — skip ephemeral reasons ("not worth it right now") and self-evident ones. Follow the repository's ADR convention when it exists; otherwise use `docs/adr/<short-title>.md` with `Status`, `Context`, `Decision`, and `Consequences`.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** See [INTERFACE-DESIGN.md](../codebase-design/INTERFACE-DESIGN.md). For deepening a cluster given its dependencies, see [DEEPENING.md](../codebase-design/DEEPENING.md).
